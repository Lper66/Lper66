# 👋 Welcome to My Lab — I'm Lper66

## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Lper66**, a curious mind in the tech world — designing, building, testing, and understanding systems from the hardware up.  
I create my own **PCBs**, develop embedded **firmware**, and love to explore and test all kinds of **tech**, from hardware interfaces to low-level systems.

I work with tools, boards, code, and concepts — learning by doing and building by understanding.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🧩 Design and build custom **PCBs**
- ⚙️ Develop my own **firmware** using **C/C++** in the **Arduino IDE**
- 🔌 Test and explore all kinds of **tech systems** and hardware
- 🧪 Build side-projects and tools to experiment and learn
- 💻 Write code in **C**, **C#**, **Python**, and a bit of **C++**
- 🔍 Reverse and analyze things at both hardware and system level
